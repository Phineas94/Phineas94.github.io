        <h2 class="card-title">Background</h2>
        <p>I’m a <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_fullstack.asp" target="_blank"><strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong></a> who loves everything about the web. I've travelled in lots of different places especially in Africa. I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of building fantastic web experiences.</p>
        <p>I’ve been an amateur ping pong player and English teacher and am a self-led learner who's always interested in expanding my skills.</p>
        <p>I've had a passion for technology since I was 22 but struggled with believing I could even enter into that industry until about 3 years ago. Initially, I was in accounting and growth hacking  at a few tech organizations but still had this inner desire to leave all of that and start creating. About 2 years ago, I started that path by joining a coding school called freecodecamp, and eventually made my way to to software development, because it's curriculum aligned more with my past personal experience which was growth hacking.</p> 
        <p> Now I've had the enough training to believe being a software engineer is the role I was born for.</p>
